Kruskal’s Algorithm is a famous greedy algorithm. It is used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. To apply Kruskal’s algorithm, the given graph must be weighted, connected and undirected.

## A simple approach to implement a linear search is -

1. First, sort all the edges from low weight to high.
2. Now, take the edge with the lowest weight and add it to the spanning tree. 
3. If the edge to be added creates a cycle, then reject the edge.
4. Continue to add the edges until we reach all vertices, and a minimum spanning tree is created.
