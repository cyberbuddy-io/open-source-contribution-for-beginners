**What is Polymorphism?**
 

The term "Polymorphism" is the combination of "poly" + "morphs" which means many forms. It is a greek word. In object-oriented programming, we use 3 main concepts: inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.

In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

Compile time Polymorphism
Runtime Polymorphism

We will be using FUNCTION OVERLOADING TO display polymorphism in c++.
In C++, we can use two functions having the same name if they have different parameters (either types or number of arguments).

And, depending upon the number/type of arguments, different functions are called.
