# **Python Data Visaulization**
 
 Data visualization is a field in data analysis that deals with visual representation of data. It graphically plots data and is an effective way to communicate inferences from data.
 
## *Description*
Python offers several plotting libraries, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn and many other such data visualization packages with different features for creating informative, customized, and appealing plots to present data in the most simple and effective way. I have used matplotlib .

## *Languages or Frameworks Used*
The programs are created with Python version 3.10 

## *PIE CHART*
A Pie Chart is a circular statistical plot that can display only one series of data. The area of the chart is the total percentage of the given data. The area of slices of the pie represents the percentage of the parts of the data. The slices of pie are called wedges.Pie charts are commonly used in business presentations like sales, operations, survey results, resources, etc as they provide a quick summary.

Let’s create a simple pie chart using the pie() function:

```
plt.show()
```
***Output***

These are the outputs of both the Pie chart code

## *HISTOGRAM*
A Histogram is a bar representation of data  that varies over a range. It plots the height of the data belonging to a range along the y-axis and the range along the x-axis. Histograms are used to plot data over a range of values. They use a bar representation to show the data belonging to each range.

Now, let’s plot a histogram using the hist() function. 

```
plt.hist(a_list,5)
```

## *BAR GRAPHS*
When you have categorical data, you can represent it with a bar graph. A bar graph plots data with the help of bars, which represent value on the y-axis and category on the x-axis. Bar graphs use bars with varying heights to show the data which belongs to a specific category.
This is the output of the given example

```
plt.show
```
