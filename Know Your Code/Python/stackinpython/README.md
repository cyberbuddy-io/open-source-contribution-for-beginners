A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner.
The functions associated with stack are:

empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity: O(1)
size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
top() – Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
push(a) – Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
pop() – Deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
