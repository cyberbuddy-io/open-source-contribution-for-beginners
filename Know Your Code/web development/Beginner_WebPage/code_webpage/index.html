    <p class="p2">Version Control Systems are the software tools for tracking/managing all the changes made to the source code during the project development. It keeps a record of every single change made to the code. It also allows us to turn back to the previous version of the code if any mistake is made in the current version. Without a VCS in place, it would not be possible to monitor the development of the project.</p>
